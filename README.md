### **Why I Created EmotiJournal**

Mental wellness is something we often overlook until stress, anxiety, or overwhelming emotions force us to pay attention. I've always believed that self-reflection is a powerful tool for growth, but traditional journaling can sometimes feel like a chore or lack direction. That’s why I wanted to create **EmotiJournal**—an app that combines the power of AI with the simplicity of journaling to make emotional self-care more intuitive and insightful.

I was inspired to build EmotiJournal after experiencing firsthand how difficult it can be to track emotions and recognize mental patterns. There were days when I struggled to understand why I felt a certain way, and I wished for a tool that could help me make sense of it all. With AI-driven insights, EmotiJournal bridges the gap between self-reflection and actionable understanding, guiding users toward emotional clarity.

**EmotiJournal is fully developed and free to use, with no in-app purchases for now. I may introduce optional features in the future, but my core vision remains the same: to make it an accessible and meaningful tool for anyone looking to improve their emotional well-being.** I'm always open to feedback and new ideas—if you have suggestions for features or improvements, I’d love to hear them!
